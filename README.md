# JCloud Flow Examples

**Note:** These are just dead simple examples for [JCloud](https://github.com/jina-ai/jcloud/) Flows, deliberately so. If you want to deploy something in production I'd recommend looking into the docs.

For each example:

1. Enter the directory
2. Deploy the Flow: `jc deploy flow.yml`
3. Note down the Flow ID
4. Index and search your data: `python app.py <Flow ID>`
